Big Woods Wildlife Management Area encompasses over 5,000 acres of diverse habitat in Sussex County, Virginia. The property features a mix of mature hardwood forests, pine plantations, and agricultural clearings that support excellent populations of whitetail deer and wild turkey.

## Habitat Description

The area's name comes from the extensive hardwood forests that dominate the landscape. Oak and hickory trees provide abundant mast crops in fall, concentrating deer activity. Open fields and food plots are maintained throughout the property to enhance wildlife habitat.

## Hunting Opportunities

### Deer Hunting
Big Woods is known for producing quality bucks. The combination of age structure management and habitat diversity creates excellent hunting opportunities. Both archery and firearms seasons are popular.

### Turkey Hunting
Spring gobbler hunting is exceptional here. The mix of open areas and timber edges provides ideal turkey habitat and hunting conditions.

### Small Game
Quail and rabbit populations benefit from the managed field edges and early successional habitat.

## Access Information

The WMA is open year-round for scouting and hunting during appropriate seasons. Multiple parking areas provide access to different sections of the property. No special permits are required beyond a valid Virginia hunting license.

## Tips for Success

- Scout early to locate food sources and travel corridors
- Consider hunting the edges where hardwoods meet agricultural fields
- Morning hunts near roosting areas are productive for turkeys
