Ragged Island Wildlife Management Area offers some of the finest waterfowl hunting in Virginia. Located along the James River in Isle of Wight County, this coastal property features managed impoundments that attract impressive numbers of ducks and geese during migration.

## Habitat Description

The WMA consists of brackish marshes, managed moist-soil impoundments, and upland forests. The impoundments are carefully managed to produce natural foods that attract migrating waterfowl.

## Hunting Opportunities

### Waterfowl
The managed impoundments provide outstanding duck and goose hunting. Mallards, black ducks, green-winged teal, and Canada geese are all common. Hunting is from designated blinds assigned through the state's lottery system.

### Rails and Snipe
The marsh habitat supports good populations of clapper rails and Wilson's snipe. These often-overlooked species provide excellent hunting opportunities.

### Deer
Limited deer hunting is available in the upland portions of the property.

## Permit Requirements

Waterfowl hunting access is controlled through the Virginia DWR's quota hunt program. Applications are accepted in late summer for the upcoming season. Competition for blinds can be significant, so apply early.

## What to Bring

- Waders (chest waders recommended)
- Decoys (some blinds have permanent spreads)
- Layout boats for some areas
- Retriever highly recommended
